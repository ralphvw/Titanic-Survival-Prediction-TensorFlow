# Titanic Survival Prediction with TensorFlow

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates the use of TensorFlow to train a model on the Titanic dataset for predicting the probabilities of survival for passengers.

## Dataset

The Titanic dataset used in this project consists of information about Titanic passengers, such as age, gender, ticket class, and whether they survived or not. The goal is to build a machine learning model that can predict the survival probabilities based on these features.

## Dependencies

To run the Jupyter Notebook successfully, you need to have the following dependencies installed:

- TensorFlow
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

You can install these dependencies using pip or any other package manager of your choice. For example:

```
pip install tensorflow jupyter pandas numpy matplotlib
```

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/ralphvw/Titanic-Survival-Prediction-TensorFlow.git
```

2. Navigate to the cloned repository:

```
cd Titanic-Survival-Prediction-TensorFlow
```

3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:

```
jupyter notebook
```

4. Open the `Titanic_Survival_Prediction.ipynb` notebook in your browser.

5. Run the notebook cells one by one to train the model and generate predictions.

## Additional notes
You might want to tweak number of epochs for better accuracy!
